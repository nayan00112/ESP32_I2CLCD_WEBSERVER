# ESP32 I2C LCD Webserver Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of an ESP32 microcontroller with an I2C LCD display through a web server. The ESP32 hosts a web server that allows users to fill out a form, and the submitted data is then displayed on the connected I2C LCD.

## Features
* Web server hosted on ESP32.
* User-friendly form to input data.
* I2C LCD display for visualizing the submitted data.
* Seamless integration between ESP32, web server, and I2C LCD.

## Hardware Requirements
* ESP32 development board.
* I2C LCD display.
* Necessary cables and connectors.


## Software Requirements
* Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support.
* Required libraries for I2C communication and LCD control.
